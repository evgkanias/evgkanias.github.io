      <title>Deep learning algorithms for multi-label data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many scientists, who specialize in supervised learning, are interested in multi-label
data for two main reasons. First of all, this type of data arising at a variety of
applications such as semantic indexing of documents, music and video, protein
function prediction, medical diagnosis, drug discovery and search engine queries
clustering. Secondly, multi-label data perform interesting research challenges like the
use of correlations between labels and scaling to a large number of labels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In multi-label data, every subject of interest is characterized by one or more labels
from a label set and the purpose is not a simple classification of an instance, but a
label ranking for their relevance to the subject or a bipartition of them to these that are
relevant and those which are not (multi-label classification). In this project, we
investigate this field and we apply a deep learning method, inspired by the theory that
explains how the brain recognizes patterns. Technology companies are reporting
startling gains in fields as diverse as computer vision, speech recognition and the
identification of promising new molecules for designing drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a fairly recent kind of neural network, the deep belief network, which
handles multi-label data without transforming them before or after the training. This
transformation is undesirable, because it causes the dataset to be bigger. Our aim is to
build a model that can handle multi-label data using deep learning techniques. In this
project, we showed that these techniques – specifically the deep learning using belief
networks – have better results in the most of the encountered subjects of interest&lt;/p&gt;
