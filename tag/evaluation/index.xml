      <description>&lt;p&gt;FI-STAR will establish early trials in the Health Care domain building on Future Internet (FI) technology leveraging on the outcomes of FI-PPP Phase 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will become self-sufficient after the end of the project and will continue on a sustainable business model by several partners. In order to meet the requirements of a global Health industry FI-STAR will use a fundamentally different, “reverse” cloud approach that is. It will bring the software to the data, rather than bringing the data to the software. FI-STAR will create a robust framework based of the “software to data” paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sustainable value chain following the life cycle of the Generic Enablers (GEs) will enable FI-STAR to grow beyond the lifetime of the project. FI-STAR will build a vertical community in order to create a sustainable ecosystem for all user groups in the global Health care and adjacent markets based on FI-PPP specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FI-STAR will deploy and execute 7 early trials across Europe, serving more than 4 million people. Through the trials FI-STAR will validate the FI-PPP core platform concept by using GEs to build its framework and will introduce ultra-light interactive applications for user functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will pro-actively engage with the FI-PPP to propose specifications and standards.FI-STAR will use the latest digital media technology for community building and will proactively prepare for Phase 3 through targeted elicitation of new partners using open calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, FI-STAR will collaborate with other FI-PPP projects, through the mechanisms in place, by actively interacting with all necessary bodies. FI-STAR is a unique opportunity for implementing Future Internet Private-Public Partnership in the Health Care domain, by offering to the community standardized and certified software including a safe, secure and resilient platform, taking advantage of all Cloud Computing benefits and guaranteeing the protection of sensitive and personal data travelling in Public Clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The RePlay project has as its goal the development of a technology platform
that shall provide access and interpretation of digital content for Traditional
Sports and Games (TSG). It will enable multiple modes of training, coaching and
knowledge sharing that will contribute to the increased participation and preservation
of traditional sport in the future. This will be achieved by developing a base
technology and methodologies for the digitisation of the art and forms of play of a
set of representative sports. In the case of RePlay, this will be field based 
Gaelic team sports and Basque individual/doubles ball and court sports. 
The fundamental structure of these sports is extensible to a vast majority of traditional
minority sports and mainstream sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RePlay will consist of the design and implementation of a platform for the capture, annotation, indexing and provision of 3D sports content. It will include the analysis and specification of methodologies and ideal cost-effective hardware solutions for the extension of the project to other sports. The project will focus on the use of existing and near future 3D motion capture hardware. The project does not include the development of any hardware as an objective, as the market is already addressing this. It shall instead focus on the creation of the knowledge and underlying software tools that will provide a low-cost entry point to other TSG associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RePlay will focus on the analysis, capture and modelling of the basic styles and techniques of play common to all participants or the &amp;ldquo;Local Hero&amp;rdquo; using low-cost capture techniques. However, RePlay will also use advanced professional grade capture techniques on &amp;ldquo;National Heroes&amp;rdquo;. A national hero, or a recognised elite player, develops their sporting prowess to an extent that is unique. This presents Intangible Cultural Heritage to be preserved, an opportunity to allow the young to try to learn and emulate their heroes, and a scientific opportunity to compare and analyse the evolution in the changes of styles of play over time. RePlay will also include work on retrospective analysis of sports via video content.&lt;/p&gt;
