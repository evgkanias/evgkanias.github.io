      <title>How noisy information informs accurate responses in natural and artificial systems</title>
      <link>https://evgkanias.github.io/project/adaptive-compass/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://evgkanias.github.io/project/adaptive-compass/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;problem&#34;&gt;PROBLEM&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animals use the sun, wind, and other directional cues to guide their behaviors. To orient themselves accurately, they must determine the relative reliability of each cue, and precisely determine, for example, where in the sky the sun is located. Many insects, however, are unable to maintain perfect gaze stabilization, i.e., they cannot fixate a stable point on their retinas while moving on the ground. This is because their heads&amp;mdash;and thus their eyes&amp;mdash;will move over large angles of perception as they transverse the world. These perturbations will be even more dramatic when moving over uneven terrain. In theory, this should provide these navigators with highly noisy sensory readings of their directional cues. Still, they navigate with impressive precision. The inability to stabilize the gaze is a problem not only for biological systems&amp;mdash;that seem to have found ways to mitigate its consequences&amp;mdash;but also in the fields of robotics, where agents often need to deal with noisy input and unpredictable postural deviations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;solution&#34;&gt;SOLUTION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To direct the highly precise steering that we still observe in animals, the neural computations that support these behaviors must be highly robust to self-motion and externally induced disturbances to the directional cues. Dung beetles are perfect organisms in which to address the solutions that have evolved to process noisy visual information to inform accurate responses for three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They orient in some of the most visually challenging habitats on earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They exhibit a singular and extremely robust orientation behaviour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A large body and brain size make them ideal for neurophysiological experiments and for carrying miniturized electronic equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 25 years of experience with this unique biological system now allows us to apply a unique combination of 3D-positional recordings, behavioral analyses, electrophysiological recordings and computational models of visual input and neural circuitry to reveal the insects’ solutions to mitigate noise. The formulated models will be evaluated on a robotic platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;project-aim&#34;&gt;PROJECT AIM&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overarching goal of this cross-disciplinary project is to reveal the solutions, honed by millions of years of evolution, that insects employ to compensate for the sensory and computational challenges imposed by navigational perturbations and noisy sensory input. In doing so, I expect to make scientific advances within animal navigation, as well as the fields of sensing, robotics, cognition, perception, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Insect-brain inspired neuromorphic nanophotonics</title>
      <link>https://evgkanias.github.io/project/insect-neuro-nano/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://evgkanias.github.io/project/insect-neuro-nano/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of the project is to develop nanophotonic on-chip devices for integrated sensing and neural computation, inspired by the insect brain.
This will uniquely combine four lines of research:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Progress in understanding insect neurobiology that provides proven circuit designs to solve significant problems such as autonomous navigation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced III-V semiconductor nanowire technology that exploits light to obtain a large number of interconnects with extremely low power consumption;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optically efficient stable molecular dyes that can be used for novel memory components;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Circuit technology developed for quantum computing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As proof of concept, we target the complete pathway from polarised light sensing in the insect eye to the internal compass and memory circuits by which this information is integrated in a continuous accurate estimate of location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is funded by the EC in the Horizon Europe programme (GA 101046790). The project started on 1st of April 2022 and run for four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is a collaboration of research groups at Lund University, the University of Copenhagen, the University of Edinburgh, and University of Groningen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exploiting invisible cues for robot navigation in complex natural environments</title>
      <link>https://evgkanias.github.io/project/invisible-cues/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://evgkanias.github.io/project/invisible-cues/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Outdoor navigation in natural environments remains a challenge for robotics.
Recent breakthroughs in robot navigation have been dependent on specific sensor
technologies, such as laser depth sensors and GPS, and advanced image processing.
The ability of animals such as ants to navigate effectively without such
power- and computation- hungry systems are a proof of principle that
alternative cheaper approaches are viable. Ants also have specialised sensing,
with a peripheral visual system that has evolved to be sensitive to crucial
cues for navigation. Specifically, they make use of non-visible (to humans)
light cues in the form of ultraviolet (UV) and polarised light detection.
UV detection allows the important signal of the horizon shape against the sky
to be easily distinguished. Polarised light detection provides an external
compass cue of heading relative to the sun direction, even when only a small
portion of the sky is visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose to build a sensory system that gathers the full range of light
cues available to the ant, in its natural ecological situation, and to analyse
the information contained in this signal. We will also analyse how the
specific sensor layout (ommatidia array), peripheral receptor characteristics,
and the motor behaviour of the ant may contribute to extracting salient
information. The data will form a test-bed for comparison of algorithmic and
neural models of the processing that underlies the navigation capabilities
of the ant. To date, these cues have been considered separately but we believe
the navigational success of this system depends on the specific combination.
For example, the directional information in the polarised sky may form an
important part of visual memories; and UV information may contribute to
disambiguation of the polarisation pattern and the robustness of this
information under different cloud conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a substantial increase in the last few years in research into
insect neural pathways involved in processing these cues which has yet to be
exploited in robot models. In particular there has been breakthrough work on
the central brain mechanisms involved in decoding polarised light to obtain
heading direction. There is also a rapidly increasing understanding of the
circuits involved in learning, a key component of navigation capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
