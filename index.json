This model\ncan estimate the solar azimuth and elevation, as well as the certainty of\nits estimations, using only the polarisation pattern of the sky. It can\ncompensate for head tilt and the change of the sun position over time,\nthus reducing errors that would arise in uneven terrains and during long\njourneys.\n\nIn this work, we demonstrate the robustness of the sensor in\nrealistic scenarios and test whether it can be efficiently used as input to\nan existing neural model of insect path integration. More specifically, we\ndesigned a set of experiments for our model that allow the validation of\nits performance in the path integration task. We simulate canopy-like\ndisturbance, covering parts of the sky and measuring the error of the sensor.\nDifferent terrain complexity is emulated by changing the maximum and minimum\naltitude of a predefined uneven terrain, producing up to 52 degrees of\ntilting angle (1m altitude variance).\n\nOur results show that, both in a\nsimulation and a prototype of the sensor (see inset in figure), the error\nof the sensor is proportional to the disturbance level. However, this did\nnot significantly affect the performance of a simulated insect integrating\nits path. We observed that when the experimental set-up is realistic enough,\nthe sensor's errors tend to be systematic. This means that errors occurring\ndue to sky disturbance and tilting of the ground during the inward path tend\nto cancel out the respective errors in the outward one. We suggest the sensor\nlayout and subsequent neural processing has evolved such that the animal's\ninteraction with its environment tends to compensate for disturbances,\nreducing the computational complexity of the compass processing required for\nrobust path integration.","tags":null,"title":"Robustness of a model of the insects' celestial compass in realistic conditions","type":"event"},{"authors":["Evripidis Gkanias","Benjamin Risse","Michael Mangan","Barbara Webb"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1563454825,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563454825,"objectID":"3ef88ee271428c3a9c266ee6d2de86e5","permalink":"https://evgkanias.github.io/publication/from-skylight-input-to-behavioural-output-a-computational-model-of-the-insect-polarised-light-compass/","publishdate":"2019-07-18T13:00:25.345Z","relpermalink":"/publication/from-skylight-input-to-behavioural-output-a-computational-model-of-the-insect-polarised-light-compass/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a new hypothesis for how insects process polarised skylight to extract global orientation information that can be used for accurate path integration.

This involved collaboration between the fields of biology and artificial intelligence that was beneficial to both fields, creating smarter artificial agents and improving the understanding of how biological systems function. The evolution of reinforcement learning during the past few years was rapid, but substantially diverged from providing insights into how biological systems work, opening a gap between reinforcement learning and biology. In attempt to close this gap, this thesis studied the insect neuroethology of reinforcement learning, that is, the neural circuits that underlie reinforcement-learning-related behaviour in insects. The goal was to extract a biologically plausible plasticity function from insect-neuroscience data, use this to explain biological findings, and compare it to more standard reinforcement learning models.\nConsequently, a novel dopaminergic plasticity rule was developed to approximate the function of dopamine as the plasticity mechanism between neurons in the insect brain. This allowed a range of observed learning phenomena to happen in parallel, like memory depression, potentiation, recovery, and saturation. In addition, by using anatomical data of connections between neurons in the mushroom body neuropils of the insect brain, the neural incentive circuit of dopaminergic and output neurons was also explored. This, together with the dopaminergic plasticity rule, allowed for dynamic collaboration amongst parallel memory functions, such as acquisition, transfer, and forgetting. When tested on olfactory conditioning paradigms, the model reproduced the observed changes in the activity of the identified neurons in fruit flies. It also replicated the observed behaviour of the animals and it allowed for flexible behavioural control. Inspired by the visual navigation system of desert ants, the model was further challenged in the visual place recognition task. Although a relatively simple encoding of the olfactory information was sufficient to explain odour learning, a more sophisticated encoding of the visual input was required to increase the separability among the visual inputs and enable visual place recognition. Signal whitening and sparse combinatorial encoding were sufficient to boost the performance of the system in this task. The incentive circuit enabled increasing confidence when familiar places were presented in a sequence but not necessarily in the correct order. Finally, the proposed model was challenged in delayed reinforcement tasks, and preliminary results suggested that the temporal resolution of the task is crucial for meaningful memory dynamics.\n","date":1535760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535760000,"objectID":"070d51a28892f81411bee8389f825d6d","permalink":"https://evgkanias.github.io/project/phd-thesis/","publishdate":"2018-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/phd-thesis/","section":"project","summary":"Thesis - Doctor of Philosophy.

Recent breakthroughs in robot navigation have been dependent on specific sensor technologies, such as laser depth sensors and GPS, and advanced image processing. The ability of animals such as ants to navigate effectively without such power- and computation- hungry systems are a proof of principle that alternative cheaper approaches are viable. Ants also have specialised sensing, with a peripheral visual system that has evolved to be sensitive to crucial cues for navigation. Specifically, they make use of non-visible (to humans) light cues in the form of ultraviolet (UV) and polarised light detection. UV detection allows the important signal of the horizon shape against the sky to be easily distinguished. Polarised light detection provides an external compass cue of heading relative to the sun direction, even when only a small portion of the sky is visible.\nWe propose to build a sensory system that gathers the full range of light cues available to the ant, in its natural ecological situation, and to analyse the information contained in this signal. We will also analyse how the specific sensor layout (ommatidia array), peripheral receptor characteristics, and the motor behaviour of the ant may contribute to extracting salient information. The data will form a test-bed for comparison of algorithmic and neural models of the processing that underlies the navigation capabilities of the ant. To date, these cues have been considered separately but we believe the navigational success of this system depends on the specific combination. For example, the directional information in the polarised sky may form an important part of visual memories; and UV information may contribute to disambiguation of the polarisation pattern and the robustness of this information under different cloud conditions.\nThere has been a substantial increase in the last few years in research into insect neural pathways involved in processing these cues which has yet to be exploited in robot models. In particular there has been breakthrough work on the central brain mechanisms involved in decoding polarised light to obtain heading direction. There is also a rapidly increasing understanding of the circuits involved in learning, a key component of navigation capabilities.\n","date":1488326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488326400,"objectID":"bc8680a19f164de7acddb81f1ab79bb9","permalink":"https://evgkanias.github.io/project/invisible-cues/","publishdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/invisible-cues/","section":"project","summary":"Design a sensor that transforms skylight into a compass direction.","tags":["robotics","computational model","bio-inspired","insect","ant","circuit","celestial","compass","central complex","navigation","skylight","polarisation"],"title":"Exploiting invisible cues for robot navigation in complex natural environments","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Biology provides the inspiration for a vision of small low-power devices that are able to learn rapidly and autonomously about environmental contingencies, enabling prediction and adaptive anticipatory action.

In this project we study these animals with respect to the physiology of their unique sensor – their vision – and their evading manoeuvres, in order to create a machine learning model, which imitates this interesting behaviour. More specifically, we propose a semi-supervised architecture of neural network, inspired by the structure of fiddler crabs’ brain and their evasion behaviour’s feedback loops. We combine location specific visual units and LSTM recurrent units in order to build a model capable to adapt this behaviour. We trained our model using a data-set we created using data from experiments done with living crabs in their habitat. Comparing our statistical results of our model’s behaviour with the ones of the original crabs behaviour we show that this model captured some key features of this behaviour as well as it seems to behave quite realistic in the simulations. Therefore, we show that it is reasonable to consider machine learning models as potential solutions in animal behaviour adaptation problems.\n","date":1454284800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1454284800,"objectID":"bb165e92cefdd0a8eb932e0b931d1480","permalink":"https://evgkanias.github.io/project/msc-thesis/","publishdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/msc-thesis/","section":"project","summary":"Disertation - Master of Science.

It will bring the software to the data, rather than bringing the data to the software. FI-STAR will create a robust framework based of the “software to data” paradigm.\nA sustainable value chain following the life cycle of the Generic Enablers (GEs) will enable FI-STAR to grow beyond the lifetime of the project. FI-STAR will build a vertical community in order to create a sustainable ecosystem for all user groups in the global Health care and adjacent markets based on FI-PPP specifications.\nFI-STAR will deploy and execute 7 early trials across Europe, serving more than 4 million people. Through the trials FI-STAR will validate the FI-PPP core platform concept by using GEs to build its framework and will introduce ultra-light interactive applications for user functionality.\nIt will pro-actively engage with the FI-PPP to propose specifications and standards.FI-STAR will use the latest digital media technology for community building and will proactively prepare for Phase 3 through targeted elicitation of new partners using open calls.\nFinally, FI-STAR will collaborate with other FI-PPP projects, through the mechanisms in place, by actively interacting with all necessary bodies. FI-STAR is a unique opportunity for implementing Future Internet Private-Public Partnership in the Health Care domain, by offering to the community standardized and certified software including a safe, secure and resilient platform, taking advantage of all Cloud Computing benefits and guaranteeing the protection of sensitive and personal data travelling in Public Clouds.\n","date":1441029600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441029600,"objectID":"de5f460c5241ea6e388e640b37ad9924","permalink":"https://evgkanias.github.io/project/fi-star/","publishdate":"2015-08-31T14:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fi-star/","section":"project","summary":"FI-STAR will establish early trials in the Health Care domain building on Future Internet (FI) technology leveraging on the outcomes of FI-PPP Phase 1.","tags":["machine learning","biomechanics","engineering","evaluation","human motion tracking","Microsoft kinect","Vicon","computer vision"],"title":"FI-STAR","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The RePlay project has as its goal the development of a technology platform that shall provide access and interpretation of digital content for Traditional Sports and Games (TSG). It will enable multiple modes of training, coaching and knowledge sharing that will contribute to the increased participation and preservation of traditional sport in the future. This will be achieved by developing a base technology and methodologies for the digitisation of the art and forms of play of a set of representative sports. In the case of RePlay, this will be field based Gaelic team sports and Basque individual/doubles ball and court sports. The fundamental structure of these sports is extensible to a vast majority of traditional minority sports and mainstream sports.\nRePlay will consist of the design and implementation of a platform for the capture, annotation, indexing and provision of 3D sports content. It will include the analysis and specification of methodologies and ideal cost-effective hardware solutions for the extension of the project to other sports. The project will focus on the use of existing and near future 3D motion capture hardware. The project does not include the development of any hardware as an objective, as the market is already addressing this. It shall instead focus on the creation of the knowledge and underlying software tools that will provide a low-cost entry point to other TSG associations.\nRePlay will focus on the analysis, capture and modelling of the basic styles and techniques of play common to all participants or the “Local Hero” using low-cost capture techniques. However, RePlay will also use advanced professional grade capture techniques on “National Heroes”. A national hero, or a recognised elite player, develops their sporting prowess to an extent that is unique. This presents Intangible Cultural Heritage to be preserved, an opportunity to allow the young to try to learn and emulate their heroes, and a scientific opportunity to compare and analyse the evolution in the changes of styles of play over time. RePlay will also include work on retrospective analysis of sports via video content.\n","date":1441029600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441029600,"objectID":"0930f6f881f05e1fa6b49e0d31e0da6c","permalink":"https://evgkanias.github.io/project/replay/","publishdate":"2015-08-31T14:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/replay/","section":"project","summary":"Digitally capturing unique skills involved in European Traditional Sports and Games.

First of all, this type of data arising at a variety of applications such as semantic indexing of documents, music and video, protein function prediction, medical diagnosis, drug discovery and search engine queries clustering. Secondly, multi-label data perform interesting research challenges like the use of correlations between labels and scaling to a large number of labels.\nIn multi-label data, every subject of interest is characterized by one or more labels from a label set and the purpose is not a simple classification of an instance, but a label ranking for their relevance to the subject or a bipartition of them to these that are relevant and those which are not (multi-label classification). In this project, we investigate this field and we apply a deep learning method, inspired by the theory that explains how the brain recognizes patterns. Technology companies are reporting startling gains in fields as diverse as computer vision, speech recognition and the identification of promising new molecules for designing drugs.\nWe present a fairly recent kind of neural network, the deep belief network, which handles multi-label data without transforming them before or after the training. This transformation is undesirable, because it causes the dataset to be bigger. Our aim is to build a model that can handle multi-label data using deep learning techniques. In this project, we showed that these techniques – specifically the deep learning using belief networks – have better results in the most of the encountered subjects of interest\n","date":1359676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1359676800,"objectID":"7693d5d0f7bea749671c6d13552fe5e5","permalink":"https://evgkanias.github.io/project/bsc-thesis/","publishdate":"2013-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/bsc-thesis/","section":"project","summary":"Honours Thesis - Bachelor of Science.
